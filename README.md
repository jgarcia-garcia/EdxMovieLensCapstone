# EdxMovieLensCapstone
As part of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science Professional Certificate, the development of a Movie Recommendation System is required.
That is the motivation for the creation of this project.

In order to achive our goal and train our algorithm, we are going to utilize one of the movie ratings datasets
available for public use in the web. In concrete, we are going to manipulate the MovieLens 10M dataset.
This dataset is provided by GroupLens, a research lab at University of Minnesota, specialized, amongst other
things, in recommender systems.

The recommendation system model will be based on studying the different effects over the rating for the
different features presented in the data set: movies, users, genres, etc...

Project main files and folders:

* RecommendationSystem.R -> R script used for developing the algorithm. Executing it will execute the algorithm for the MovieLens dataset

* MovieRecommendationSystem.Rmd -> R markdown file with programming instructions that will help us to knit the output pdf

* MovieRecommendationSystem.pdf -> PDF file containing the final report generated using the Rmd file as a base

* Figs folder -> Folder containing figures and plots included in the PDF for illustrating the results of our algorithm
